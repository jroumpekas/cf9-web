    <p>
        This is an example of text that will overflow its container. The container has a fixed width and height, and the text inside it is too long to fit within those dimensions. As a result, the overflow property will determine how the excess text is handled. Depending on the CSS settings, the overflow can be hidden, scrollable, or visible outside the container.
